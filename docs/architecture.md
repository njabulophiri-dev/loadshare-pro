# Tech Stack:

- Next.js (App Router) — SEO, server rendering, production realism
- PostgreSQL — relational integrity, future analytics
- Prisma — schema-driven development, safety
- Tailwind — velocity without chaos
- Vercel — realistic deployment target

# Why this stack?

LoadShare Pro is designed as a production-grade platform from day one. Every technology choice is intentional and aligned with scalability, developer experience and long-term maintainability.

## Next.js (App Router)

Next.js provides a full-stack React framework that enables server-side rendering, server components and API routes in a single cohesive architecture.
The App Router allows for clearer separation between server and client concerns, improved data-fetching patterns and predictable routing — critical for building a performant, SEO-friendly platform with real user flows.

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a proven, relational database well-suited for structured, transactional data.
LoadShare Pro relies on strong data consistency for users, businesses, availability windows and locations — making PostgreSQL a natural fit over schemaless alternatives.

## Prisma

Prisma acts as a type-safe data access layer between the application and the database.
It improves developer productivity, reduces runtime errors and makes schema changes explicit and version-controlled. Prisma also keeps the data model close to the application logic, which is essential for rapid iteration without sacrificing correctness.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind enables a utility-first styling approach that keeps styles close to components while avoiding global CSS complexity.
This makes the UI consistent, responsive and easy to evolve without large refactors — especially important for a product that will grow feature-by-feature.

## Vercel

Vercel provides first-class support for Next.js, enabling seamless deployments, preview environments, and edge-optimized performance.
It allows the focus to stay on product and engineering decisions rather than infrastructure management, while still supporting production-grade workloads.

# Architectural intent

## This stack supports:

- Server-rendered and client-interactive pages
- Clean separation of UI, business logic and data access
- Incremental feature development without rewrites
- A clear path to authentication, payments and API integrations

The goal is not to chase trends, but to build a reliable, scalable platform using tools that are widely adopted in modern production systems.
